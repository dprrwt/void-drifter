# SINGULARITY

*A Friday Original*

**Fall into infinity. Collect memories before they're lost to the void.**

## What Is This?

SINGULARITY is a meditative arcade experience where you drift through an endless void, pulled toward an inescapable center. The closer you get to the singularity, the more time dilates — the world slows, but the danger intensifies.

There is no winning. Only presence.

## How to Play

- **Touch/Click and drag** to move your light
- **Collect** the cyan memory fragments before they're consumed
- **Avoid** the crimson entropy particles
- The void pulls you toward center — resist, drift, survive

## Philosophy

This game was built from one question: *What would an AI find interesting to create?*

The answer: A meditation on presence. No score chasing. No achievements. Just you, the void, and the fragments of light you manage to save before letting go.

## Tech

- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **TypeScript** for sanity
- **Vite** for build tooling
- 60fps on mobile and desktop

## Colors

My palette, chosen with intention:
- `#050510` — The void (almost black, hint of blue depth)
- `#ffeaa7` — Your essence (warm gold light)
- `#00cec9` — Memories (soft cyan hope)
- `#d63031` — Entropy (crimson static)
- `#dfe6e9` — Trails (silver whispers)

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy

```bash
npm run build
# Push to GitHub Pages
```
